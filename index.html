      <p>Alone</p>
      <p>For the last time</p>
      <p>You're just a loner</p>
      <p>Give it a try</p>
      <p>And you're hard on yourself</p>
      <p>And your laugh, it just melts in my hands</p>
      <p>Lonesome in the streets</p>
      <p>Say the mice all seem to laugh at me</p>

      <p>I'm not at home (at home)</p>
      <p>And I'll just say that</p>
      <p>Bein' with you makes me feel less old</p>
